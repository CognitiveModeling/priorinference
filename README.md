# RSApackage - test

This package contains all the functions of the common code of the RSA model. This package was designed to analyze and model data for Experiments 1 and 2 in the paper Learning about others: Modeling social inference through ambiguity resolution (Achimova et al. (submitted)).

## To be able to use the RSApackage you need to follow these steps:
1. Install the package `devtools`.
Run the code below:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```

2. Run the command:
```
library("devtools")
```

3. Now you will be able to install the `RSApackage` by running:
```
install_github("haniaelkersh/rsa-publish-test")
```
