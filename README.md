# RSApackage - test

This package contains all the functions of the common code of the RSA model. This package was designed to analyze and model data for Experiments 1 and 2 in the paper Learning about others: Modeling social inference through ambiguity resolution (Achimova et al. (submitted)).

## To be able to use the RSApackage you need to follow these steps:
1. Install the package `devtools`.
Run the code below:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```

2. Run the command:
```
library("devtools")
```

3. Now you will be able to install the `RSApackage` by running:
```
install_github("haniaelkersh/rsa-publish-test")
```

## To replicate the experiments 1 and 2 from the paper open the matching manual and follow the steps.

### Experiment 2
#### _Epistemic utterance choice_
The goal of Experiment 2 is to check the predictions of the strategic utterance selection model. Given a set of potential referents S, will participants reason pragmatically about the anticipated potential epistemic utility of utterances u∈ U for inferring the listener’s preferences?
Task
Participants encountered a reference game scenario similar to Experiment 1. The task was to help the speaker choose an utterance that was most likely to reveal the listener’s shape, pattern or color preferences. The same sets of objects from Experiment 1, which could vary along three dimensions, were used.
Each trial featured a set of three objects. Participants adjusted sliders to indicate whether a single-feature utterance could help the speaker learn about the preferences of their listener. Potential utterances corresponded to the features of the objects present; depending on the number of unique features, participants adjusted between three and nine sliders.
